Using off-the-shelf\\nimages also reduces the learning curve for new users. If you have software that you\\nwant to containerize and you’re in a rush, then part 2 will likely answer more of\\nyour direct questions.\\nIn this chapter, you’ll install a web server called NGINX. Web servers are programs\\nthat make website files and programs accessible to web browsers over a network.\\n19\\n20\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\nYou’re not going to build a website, but you are going to install and start a web server\\nwith Docker.\\nControlling containers: Building a website monitor\\n2.1\\nSuppose a new client walks into your office and makes an outrageous request for you\\nto build them a new website: they want a website that’s closely monitored. This partic-\\nular client wants to run their own operations, so they’ll want the solution you provide\\nto email their team when the server is down. They’ve also heard about this popular\\nweb server software called NGINX and have specifically requested that you use it. Hav-\\ning read about the merits of working with Docker, you’ve decided to use it for this\\nproject. Figure 2.1 shows your planned architecture for the project.\\nA container created\\nfrom the mailer image,\\nwhich depends on\\nnetwork port 33333\\nA container created from the watcher\\nimage, which depends on the nginx\\ncontainer and the mailer container\\nPort 80\\nnginx\\nwatcher\\nPort 33333\\nmailer\\nA container created\\nfrom the nginx image,\\nwhich depends on\\nnetwork port 80\\nThe three containers that you’ll build in this example\\nFigure 2.1\\nThis example uses three containers. The first will run NGINX; the second will run a\\nprogram called a mailer. Both of these will run as detached containers. Detached means\\nthat the container will run in the background, without being attached to any input or\\noutput stream. A third program named watcher will run as a monitoring agent in an\\ninteractive container. Both the mailer and watcher agent are small scripts created for\\nthis example. In this section, you’ll learn how to do the following:\\n\\uf0a1Create detached and interactive containers\\n\\uf0a1List containers on your system\\n\\uf0a1View container logs\\n\\uf0a1Stop and restart containers\\n\\uf0a1Reattach a terminal to a container\\n\\uf0a1Detach from an attached container\\nWithout further delay, let’s get started filling your client’s order.\\n21\\nControlling containers: Building a website monitor\\nCreating and starting a new container\\n2.1.1\\nDocker calls the collection of files and instructions needed to run a software pro-\\ngram an image. When we install software with Docker, we are really using Docker to\\ndownload or create an image. There are different ways to install an image and sev-\\neral sources for images. Images are covered in more detail in chapter 3, but for now\\nyou can think of them as the shipping containers used to transport physical goods\\naround the world. Docker images hold everything a computer needs in order to run\\nsoftware.\\n In this example, we’re going to download and install an image for NGINX from\\nDocker Hub. Remember, Docker Hub is the public registry provided by Docker Inc.\\nThe NGINX image is what Docker Inc. calls a trusted repository. Generally, the person\\nor foundation that publishes the software controls the trusted repositories for that\\nsoftware. Running the following command will download, install, and start a container\\nrunning NGINX:\\ndocker run --detach \\\\          \\n    --name web nginx:latest\\nWhen you run this command, Docker will install nginx:latest from the NGINX\\nrepository hosted on Docker Hub (covered in chapter 3) and run the software. After\\nDocker has installed and started running NGINX, one line of seemingly random char-\\nacters will be written to the terminal. It will look something like this: \\n7cb5d2b9a7eab87f07182b5bf58936c9947890995b1b94f412912fa822a9ecb5\\nThat blob of characters is the unique identifier of the container that was just created\\nto run NGINX. Every time you run docker run and create a new container, that new\\ncontainer will get a unique identifier. It’s common for users to capture this output\\nwith a variable for use with other commands. You don’t need to do so for the purposes\\nof this example.\\n After the identifier is displayed, it might not seem like anything has happened.\\nThat’s because you used the --detach option and started the program in the back-\\nground. This means that the program started but isn’t attached to your terminal. It\\nmakes sense to start NGINX this way because we’re going to run a few programs.\\nServer software is generally run in detached containers because it is rare that the soft-\\nware depends on an attached terminal.\\n Running detached containers is a perfect fit for programs that sit quietly in the\\nbackground. That type of program is called a daemon, or a service. A daemon generally\\ninteracts with other programs or humans over a network or some other communica-\\ntion channel. When you launch a daemon or other program in a container that you\\nwant to run in the background, remember to use either the --detach flag or its short\\nform, -d. \\nNote the \\ndetach flag.\\n22\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\n Another daemon that your client needs in this example is a mailer. A mailer waits\\nfor connections from a caller and then sends an email. The following command\\ninstalls and run a mailer that will work for this example:\\ndocker run -d \\\\           \\n    --name mailer \\\\\\n    dockerinaction/ch2_mailer\\nThis command uses the short form of the --detach flag to start a new container\\nnamed mailer in the background. At this point, you’ve run two commands and deliv-\\nered two-thirds of the system that your client wants. The last component, called the\\nagent, is a good fit for an interactive container.\\n2.1.2\\nRunning interactive containers\\nA terminal-based text editor is a great example of a program that requires an attached\\nterminal. It takes input from the user via a keyboard (and maybe mouse) and displays\\noutput on the terminal. It is interactive over its input and output streams. Running\\ninteractive programs in Docker requires that you bind parts of your terminal to the\\ninput or output of a running container. \\n To get started working with interactive containers, run the following command:\\ndocker run --interactive --tty \\\\   \\n    --link web:web \\\\\\n    --name web_test \\\\\\n    busybox:1.29 /bin/sh\\n \\n \\nStarts \\ndetached\\nCreates a virtual \\nterminal and \\nbinds stdin\\nThe command uses two flags on the run command: --interactive (or -i) and --tty\\n(or -t). First, the --interactive option tells Docker to keep the standard input\\nstream (stdin) open for the container even if no terminal is attached. Second, the --tty\\noption tells Docker to allocate a virtual terminal for the container, which will allow\\nyou to pass signals to the container. This is usually what you want from an interactive\\ncommand-line program. You’ll usually use both of these when you’re running an\\ninteractive program such as a shell in an interactive container.\\nJust as important as the interactive flags, when you started this container, you spec-\\nified the program to run inside the container. In this case, you ran a shell program\\ncalled sh. You can run any program that’s available inside the container.\\nThe command in the interactive container example creates a container, starts a\\nUNIX shell, and is linked to the container that’s running NGINX. From this shell, you\\ncan run a command to verify that your web server is running correctly:\\nwget -O - http://web:80/\\nThis uses a program called wget to make an HTTP request to the web server (the\\nNGINX server you started earlier in a container) and then display the contents of the\\nweb page on your terminal. Among the other lines, there should be a message like\\nWelcome to NGINX! If you see that message, then everything is working correctly, and\\n23\\nControlling containers: Building a website monitor\\nyou can go ahead and shut down this interactive container by typing exit. This will\\nterminate the shell program and stop the container.\\n It’s possible to create an interactive container, manually start a process inside that\\ncontainer, and then detach your terminal. You can do so by holding down the Ctrl\\n(or Control) key and pressing P and then Q. This will work only when you’ve used the\\n--tty option. \\n To finish the work for your client, you need to start an agent. This is a monitoring\\nagent that will test the web server as you did in the preceding example and send a\\nmessage with the mailer if the web server stops. This command will start the agent in\\nan interactive container by using the short-form flags:\\ndocker run -it \\\\         \\n    --name agent \\\\\\n    --link web:insideweb \\\\\\n    --link mailer:insidemailer \\\\\\n    dockerinaction/ch2_agent\\n \\n2.1.3\\n \\nCreates a virtual \\nterminal and \\nbinds stdin\\nWhen running, the container will test the web container every second and print a\\nmessage like the following:\\nSystem up.\\nNow that you’ve seen what it does, detach your terminal from the container. Specifi-\\ncally, when you start the container and it begins writing System up, hold the Ctrl (or\\nControl) key and then press P and then Q. After doing so, you’ll be returned to the\\nshell for your host computer. Do not stop the program; otherwise, the monitor will\\nstop checking the web server.\\nAlthough you’ll usually use detached or daemon containers for software that you\\ndeploy to servers on your network, interactive containers are useful for running soft-\\nware on your desktop or for manual work on a server. At this point, you’ve started all\\nthree applications in containers that your client needs. Before you can confidently\\nclaim completion, you should test the system.\\nListing, stopping, restarting, and viewing output of containers\\nThe first thing you should do to test your current setup is check which containers are\\ncurrently running by using the docker ps command:\\ndocker ps\\nRunning the command will display the following information about each running\\ncontainer:\\n\\uf0a1The container ID\\n\\uf0a1The image used\\n\\uf0a1The command executed in the container\\n\\uf0a1The time since the container was created\\n24\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\n\\uf0a1The duration that the container has been running\\n\\uf0a1The network ports exposed by the container\\n\\uf0a1The name of the container\\nAt this point, you should have three running containers with names: web, mailer, and\\nagent. If any is missing but you’ve followed the example thus far, it may have been\\nmistakenly stopped. This isn’t a problem because Docker has a command to restart a\\ncontainer. The next three commands will restart each container by using the con-\\ntainer name. Choose the appropriate ones to restart the containers that were missing\\nfrom the list of running containers:\\ndocker restart web\\ndocker restart mailer\\ndocker restart agent\\nNow that all three containers are running, you need to test that the system is operat-\\ning correctly. The best way to do that is to examine the logs for each container. Start\\nwith the web container:\\ndocker logs web\\nThat should display a long log with several lines that contain this substring:\\n\"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 200\\nThis means that the web server is running and that the agent is testing the site. Each\\ntime the agent tests the site, one of these lines will be written to the log. The docker\\nlogs command can be helpful for these cases but is dangerous to rely on. Anything\\nthat the program writes to the stdout or stderr output streams will be recorded in this\\nlog. The problem with this pattern is that the log is never rotated or truncated by\\ndefault, so the data written to the log for a container will remain and grow as long as\\nthe container exists. That long-term persistence can be a problem for long-lived pro-\\ncesses. A better way to work with log data uses volumes and is discussed in chapter 4.\\nYou can tell that the agent is monitoring the web server by examining the logs for\\nweb alone. For completeness, you should examine the log output for mailer and\\nagent as well:\\ndocker logs mailer\\ndocker logs agent\\nThe logs for mailer should look something like this:\\nCH2 Example Mailer has started.\\nThe logs for agent should contain several lines like the one you watched it write when\\nyou started the container:\\nSystem up.\\n25\\nSolved problems and the PID namespace\\nTIP\\nThe docker logs command has a flag, --follow or -f, that will display\\nthe logs and then continue watching and updating the display with changes\\nto the log as they occur. When you’ve finished, press Ctrl-C (or Command-C)\\nto interrupt the logs command. \\nNow that you’ve validated that the containers are running and that the agent can\\nreach the web server, you should test that the agent will notice when the web con-\\ntainer stops. When that happens, the agent should trigger a call to the mailer, and the\\nevent should be recorded in the logs for both agent and mailer. The docker stop\\ncommand tells the program with PID 1 in the container to halt. Use it in the following\\ncommands to test the system:\\ndocker stop web            \\ndocker logs mailer    \\nLook for a line at the end of the mailer logs that reads like this: \\nSending email: To: admin@work  Message: The service is down!\\nThat line means the agent successfully detected that the NGINX server in the con-\\ntainer named web had stopped. Congratulations! Your client will be happy, and you’ve\\nbuilt your first real system with containers and Docker.\\n Learning the basic Docker features is one thing, but understanding why they’re\\nuseful and how to use them to customize isolation is another task entirely. \\n2.2\\nSolved problems and the PID namespace\\nEvery running program—or process—on a Linux machine has a unique number\\ncalled a process identifier (PID). A PID namespace is a set of unique numbers that identify\\nprocesses. Linux provides tools to create multiple PID namespaces. Each namespace\\nhas a complete set of possible PIDs. This means that each PID namespace will contain\\nits own PID 1, 2, 3, and so on.\\n Most programs will not need access to other running processes or be able to list\\nthe other running processes on the system. And so Docker creates a new PID name-\\nspace for each container by default. A container’s PID namespace isolates processes in\\nthat container from processes in other containers.\\n From the perspective of a process in one container with its own namespace, PID 1\\nmight refer to an init system process such as runit or supervisord. In a different con-\\ntainer, PID 1 might refer to a command shell such as bash. Run the following to see it\\nin action:\\ndocker run -d --name namespaceA \\\\\\n    busybox:1.29 /bin/sh -c \"sleep 30000\"\\ndocker run -d --name namespaceB \\\\\\n    busybox:1.29 /bin/sh -c \"nc -l 0.0.0.0 -p 80\"\\nStops the web server by \\nstopping the container\\nWaits a couple of seconds \\nand checks the mailer logs\\n26\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\ndocker exec namespaceA ps      \\ndocker exec namespaceB ps        \\nCommand B should generate a process list similar to the following:\\nPID   USER     TIME  COMMAND\\n  1   root     0:00  sleep 30000\\n  8   root     0:00  ps\\nCommand c should generate a slightly different process list:\\nPID   USER     TIME  COMMAND\\n-p 80\\n0.0.0.0\\n1   root     0:00  nc -l\\n  9   root     0:00  ps\\nIn this example, you use the docker exec command to run additional processes in a\\nrunning container. In this case, the command you use is called ps, which shows all the\\nrunning processes and their PID. From the output, you can clearly see that each con-\\ntainer has a process with PID 1.\\n Without a PID namespace, the processes running inside a container would share\\nthe same ID space as those in other containers or on the host. A process in a container\\nwould be able to determine what other processes were running on the host machine.\\nWorse, processes in one container might be able to control processes in other contain-\\ners. A process that cannot reference any processes outside its namespace is limited in\\nits ability to perform targeted attacks.\\n Like most Docker isolation features, you can optionally create containers without\\ntheir own PID namespace. This is critical if you are using a program to perform a sys-\\ntem administration task that requires process enumeration from within a container.\\nYou can try this yourself by setting the --pid flag on docker create or docker run and\\nsetting the value to host. Try it yourself with a container running BusyBox Linux and\\nthe ps Linux command:\\ndocker run --pid host busybox:1.29 ps    \\nBecause containers all have their own PID namespace, they both cannot gain mean-\\ningful insight from examining it, and can take more static dependencies on it. Sup-\\npose a container runs two processes: a server and a local process monitor. That monitor\\ncould take a hard dependency on the server’s expected PID and use that to monitor\\nand control the server. This is an example of environment independence. \\n Consider the previous web-monitoring example. Suppose you were not using\\nDocker and were just running NGINX directly on your computer. Now suppose you\\nforgot that you had already started NGINX for another project. When you start\\nNGINX again, the second process won’t be able to access the resources it needs\\nbecause the first process already has them. This is a basic software conflict example.\\nYou can see it in action by trying to run two copies of NGINX in the same container:\\n b c\\nShould list all processes \\nrunning on the computer\\n27\\nSolved problems and the PID namespace\\ndocker run -d --name webConflict nginx:latest\\ndocker logs webConflict                       \\ndocker exec webConflict nginx -g \\'daemon off;\\'    \\nThe last command should display output like this:\\n2015/03/29 22:04:35 [emerg] 10#0: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: \\nAddress already in use)\\nnginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)\\n...\\nThe second process fails to start properly and reports that the address it needs is\\nalready in use. Called a port conflict, this is a common issue in real-world systems in\\nwhich several processes are running on the same computer or multiple people con-\\ntribute to the same environment. It’s a great example of a conflict problem that\\nDocker simplifies and solves. Run each in a different container, like this:\\ndocker run -d --name webA nginx:latest    \\ndocker logs webA                      \\ndocker run -d --name webB nginx:latest   \\ndocker logs webB     \\nEnvironment independence provides the freedom to configure software taking\\ndependencies on scarce system resources without regard for other co-located software\\nwith conflicting requirements. Here are some common conflict problems:\\n\\uf0a1Two programs want to bind to the same network port.\\n\\uf0a1Two programs use the same temporary filename, and file locks are preventing\\nthat.\\n\\uf0a1Two programs want to use different versions of a globally installed library.\\n\\uf0a1Two processes want to use the same PID file.\\n\\uf0a1A second program you installed modified an environment variable that another\\nprogram uses. Now the first program breaks.\\n\\uf0a1Multiple processes are competing for memory or CPU time.\\nAll these conflicts arise when one or more programs have a common dependency but\\ncan’t agree to share or have different needs. As in the earlier port conflict example,\\nDocker solves software conflicts with such tools as Linux namespaces, resource limits,\\nfilesystem roots, and virtualized network components. All these tools are used to iso-\\nlate software inside a Docker container.\\nOutput should \\nbe empty.\\nStarts a second NGINX process\\nin the same container\\nStarts the first \\nNGINX instance\\nVerifies that it is working; \\nshould be empty.\\nStarts the second \\ninstance\\nVerifies that it is working; \\nshould be empty\\n28\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\nEliminating metaconflicts: Building a website farm\\n2.3\\nIn the preceding section, you saw how Docker helps you avoid software conflicts with\\nprocess isolation. But if you’re not careful, you can end up building systems that cre-\\nate metaconflicts, or conflicts between containers in the Docker layer. \\n Consider another example: a client has asked you to build a system on which you\\ncan host a variable number of websites for their customers. They’d also like to employ\\nthe same monitoring technology that you built earlier in this chapter. Expanding the\\nsystem you built earlier would be the simplest way to get this job done without custom-\\nizing the configuration for NGINX. In this example, you’ll build a system with several\\ncontainers running web servers and a monitoring watcher for each web server. The\\nsystem will look like the architecture described in figure 2.2.\\nYour first instinct might be to simply start more web containers. But that’s not as sim-\\nple as it looks. Identifying containers gets complicated as the number of containers\\nincreases.\\n2.3.1\\nFlexible container identification\\nThe best way to find out why simply creating more copies of the NGINX container you\\nused in the previous example is a bad idea is to try it for yourself:\\ndocker run -d --name webid nginx      \\ndocker run -d --name webid nginx   \\nPort 80\\nnginx\\nwatcher\\nPort 33333\\nmailer\\nPort 80\\nnginx\\nwatcher\\nPort 80\\nnginx\\nwatcher\\n…\\nFigure 2.2\\nA fleet of web server \\ncontainers and related monitoring agents\\nCreates a container \\nnamed \"webid\"\\nCreates another container \\nnamed \"webid\"\\nThe second command here will fail with a conflict error:\\nFATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Conflict. The name \"webid\" is\\nalready in use by container 2b5958ba6a00. You have to delete (or rename)\\nthat container to be able to reuse that name.\\n29\\nEliminating metaconflicts: Building a website farm\\nUsing fixed container names such as web is useful for experimentation and documen-\\ntation, but in a system with multiple containers, using fixed names like that can create\\nconflicts. By default, Docker assigns a unique (human-friendly) name to each con-\\ntainer it creates. The --name flag overrides that process with a known value. If a situa-\\ntion arises in which the name of a container needs to change, you can always rename\\nthe container with the docker rename command:\\ndocker rename webid webid-old       \\ndocker run -d --name webid nginx    \\nRenames the current web \\ncontainer to \"webid-old\"\\nCreates another container \\nnamed \"webid\"\\nRenaming containers can help alleviate one-off naming conflicts but does little to\\nhelp avoid the problem in the first place. In addition to the name, Docker assigns a\\nunique identifier that was mentioned in the first example. These are hex-encoded\\n1024-bit numbers and look something like this:\\n7cb5d2b9a7eab87f07182b5bf58936c9947890995b1b94f412912fa822a9ecb5\\nWhen containers are started in detached mode, their identifier will be printed to the\\nterminal. You can use these identifiers in place of the container name with any com-\\nmand that needs to identify a specific container. For example, you could use the previ-\\nous ID with a stop or exec command:\\ndocker exec \\\\\\n7cb5d2b9a7eab87f07182b5bf58936c9947890995b1b94f412912fa822a9ecb5 \\\\\\necho hello\\ndocker stop \\\\\\n7cb5d2b9a7eab87f07182b5bf58936c9947890995b1b94f412912fa822a9ecb5\\nThe high probability of uniqueness of the IDs that are generated means that it is\\nunlikely that there will ever be a collision with this ID. To a lesser degree, it is also\\nunlikely that there would even be a collision of the first 12 characters of this ID on the\\nsame computer. So in most Docker interfaces, you’ll see container IDs truncated to\\ntheir first 12 characters. This makes generated IDs a bit more user-friendly. You can\\nuse them wherever a container identifier is required. The previous two commands\\ncould be written like this:\\ndocker exec 7cb5d2b9a7ea ps\\ndocker stop 7cb5d2b9a7ea\\nNeither of these IDs is particularly well suited for human use. But they work well with\\nscripts and automation techniques. Docker has several means of acquiring the ID of a\\ncontainer to make automation possible. In these cases, the full or truncated numeric\\nID will be used.\\nThe first way to get the numeric ID of a container is to simply start or create a new\\none and assign the result of the command to a shell variable. As you saw earlier, when\\n30\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\na new container is started in detached mode, the container ID will be written to the\\nterminal (stdout). You’d be unable to use this with interactive containers if this were\\nthe only way to get the container ID at creation time. Luckily, you can use another\\ncommand to create a container without starting it. The docker create command is\\nsimilar to docker run, the primary difference being that the container is created in a\\nstopped state:\\ndocker create nginx\\nThe result should be a line like this:\\nb26a631e536d3caae348e9fd36e7661254a11511eb2274fb55f9f7c788721b0d\\nIf you’re using a Linux command shell such as sh or bash, you can assign that result to\\na shell variable and use it again later:\\nCID=$(docker create nginx:latest)   \\necho $CID\\nShell variables create a new opportunity for conflict, but the scope of that conflict is\\nlimited to the terminal session or current processing environment in which the script\\nwas launched. Those conflicts should be easily avoidable because one use or program\\nis managing that environment. The problem with this approach is that it won’t help if\\nmultiple users or automated processes need to share that information. In those cases,\\nyou can use a container ID (CID) file.\\n Both the docker run and docker create commands provide another flag to write\\nthe ID of a new container to a known file: \\ndocker create --cidfile /tmp/web.cid nginx     \\ncat /tmp/web.cid   \\nLike the use of shell variables, this feature increases the opportunity for conflict. The\\nname of the CID file (provided after --cidfile) must be known or have some known\\nstructure. Just like manual container naming, this approach uses known names in a\\nglobal (Docker-wide) namespace. The good news is that Docker won’t create a new\\ncontainer by using the provided CID file if that file already exists. The command will\\nfail just as it does when you create two containers with the same name.\\n One reason to use CID files instead of names is that CID files can be shared with\\ncontainers easily and renamed for that container. This uses a Docker feature called\\nvolumes, which is covered in chapter 4. \\nTIP\\nOne strategy for dealing with CID file-naming collisions is to partition\\nthe namespace by using known or predictable path conventions. For example,\\nin this scenario, you might use a path that contains all web containers under\\na known directory and further partition that directory by the customer ID.\\nThis will work on \\nPOSIX-compliant shells.\\nCreates a new \\nstopped container\\nInspects the file\\n31\\nEliminating metaconflicts: Building a website farm\\nThis would result in a path such as /containers/web/customer1/web.cid or\\n/containers/web/customer8/web.cid.\\nIn other cases, you can use other commands such as docker ps to get the ID of a con-\\ntainer. For example, if you want to get the truncated ID of the last created container,\\nyou can use this:\\nCID=$(docker ps --latest --quiet)     \\necho $CID\\nCID=$(docker ps -l -q)   \\necho $CID\\nTIP\\nIf you want to get the full container ID, you can use the --no-trunc\\noption on the docker ps command.\\nAutomation cases are covered by the features you’ve seen so far. But even though\\ntruncation helps, these container IDs are rarely easy to read or remember. For this\\nreason, Docker also generates human-readable names for each container. \\n The naming convention uses a personal adjective; an underscore; and the last\\nname of an influential scientist, engineer, inventor, or other such thought leader.\\nExamples of generated names are compassionate_swartz, hungry_goodall, and\\ndistracted_turing. These seem to hit a sweet spot for readability and memory.\\nWhen you’re working with the docker tool directly, you can always use docker ps to\\nlook up the human-friendly names.\\n Container identification can be tricky, but you can manage the issue by using the\\nID and name-generation features of Docker. \\n2.3.2\\nContainer state and dependencies\\nWith this new knowledge, the new system might look something like this:\\nMAILER_CID=$(docker run -d dockerinaction/ch2_mailer)         \\nWEB_CID=$(docker create nginx)\\nAGENT_CID=$(docker create --link $WEB_CID:insideweb \\\\\\n    --link $MAILER_CID:insidemailer \\\\\\n    dockerinaction/ch2_agent)\\n \\nThis will work on \\nPOSIX-compliant shells.\\nRun again with the \\nshort-form flags.\\nMake sure mailer \\nfrom first example \\nis running.\\nThis snippet could be used to seed a new script that launches a new NGINX and agent\\ninstance for each of your client’s customers. You can use docker ps to see that they’ve\\nbeen created:\\ndocker ps\\nThe reason neither the NGINX nor the agent was included with the output has to do\\nwith container state. Docker containers will be in one of the states shown in figure 2.3.\\nThe Docker container management commands to move between states annotate each\\ntransition.\\n32\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\nNeither of the new containers you started appears in the list of containers because\\ndocker ps shows only running containers by default. Those containers were specifi-\\ncally created with docker create and never started (the created state). To see all the\\ncontainers (including those in the created state), use the -a option:\\ndocker ps -a \\nThe status of the new containers should be \"Created\". The docker ps command dis-\\nplays the container state using the “friendly” names shown in gray in figure 2.3. The\\ndocker inspect command uses the names shown in the bottom half of each state (for\\nexample, created). The restarting, removing, and dead (not illustrated) states are\\ninternal to Docker and are used to track transitions between the states visible in\\ndocker ps.\\n Now that you’ve verified that both of the containers were created, you need to start\\nthem. For that, you can use the docker start command:\\ndocker start $AGENT_CID\\ndocker start $WEB_CID\\nRunning those commands will result in an error. The containers need to be started in\\nreverse order of their dependency chain. Because you tried to start the agent con-\\ntainer before the web container, Docker reported a message like this one: \\nError response from daemon: Cannot start container\\n03e65e3c6ee34e714665a8dc4e33fb19257d11402b151380ed4c0a5e38779d0a: Cannot\\nlink to a non running container: /clever_wright AS /modest_hopper/insideweb\\nFATA[0000] Error: failed to start one or more containers\\nrestart\\n\"Created\"\\nStatus printed by:\\ndocker ps\\ndocker inspect\\nstart |\\nstart |\\nrestart\\ncreate |\\nrun\\nstop |\\nkill |\\nremove\\nrestart\\ncreated\\n\"Up\"\\nrunning\\n\"Exited\"\\nexited\\nNo container\\n\"Up (paused)\"\\npaused\\nrestarting\\npause\\nunpause\\nremove\\nremoving\\nThe state transition diagram for Docker containers\\nFigure 2.3\\n33\\nEliminating metaconflicts: Building a website farm\\nIn this example, the agent container has a dependency on the web container. You\\nneed to start the web container first:\\ndocker start $WEB_CID\\ndocker start $AGENT_CID\\nThis makes sense when you consider the mechanics at work. The link mechanism injects\\nIP addresses into dependent containers, and containers that aren’t running don’t have\\nIP addresses. If you tried to start a container that has a dependency on a container that\\nisn’t running, Docker wouldn’t have an IP address to inject. In chapter 5, you’ll learn to\\nconnect containers with user-defined bridge networks to avoid this particular depen-\\ndency problem. The key point here is that Docker will try to resolve a container’s depen-\\ndencies before creating or starting a container to avoid application runtime failures.\\n \\n \\nThe legacy of container network linking\\nYou may notice that the Docker documentation describes network links as a legacy\\nfeature. Network links were an early and popular way to connect containers. Links cre-\\nate a unidirectional network connection from one container to other containers on the\\nsame host. Significant portions of the container ecosystem asked for fully peered,\\nbidirectional connections between containers. Docker provides this with the user-\\ndefined networks described in chapter 5. These networks can also extend across a\\ncluster of hosts as described in chapter 13. Network links and user-defined networks\\nare not equivalent, but Docker recommends migrating to user-defined networks.\\nIt is uncertain whether the container network linking feature will ever be removed.\\nNumerous useful tools and unidirectional communication patterns depend on linking,\\nas illustrated by the containers used to inspect and watch the web and mailer com-\\nponents in this section.\\nWhether you’re using docker run or docker create, the resulting containers need to\\nbe started in the reverse order of their dependency chain. This means that circular\\ndependencies are impossible to build using Docker container relationships.\\nAt this point, you can put everything together into one concise script that looks\\nlike this:\\nMAILER_CID=$(docker run -d dockerinaction/ch2_mailer)\\nWEB_CID=$(docker run -d nginx)\\nAGENT_CID=$(docker run -d \\\\\\n--link $WEB_CID:insideweb \\\\\\n--link $MAILER_CID:insidemailer \\\\\\ndockerinaction/ch2_agent)\\nNow you’re confident that this script can be run without exception each time your cli-\\nent needs to provision a new site. Your client has returned and thanked you for the\\nweb and monitoring work you’ve completed so far, but things have changed.\\n34\\n2.4\\n2.4.1\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\nThey’ve decided to focus on building their websites with WordPress (a popular\\nopen source content-management and blogging program). Luckily, WordPress is pub-\\nlished through Docker Hub in a repository named wordpress. All you’ll need to deliver\\nis a set of commands to provision a new WordPress website that has the same monitor-\\ning and alerting features that you’ve already delivered.\\nAn interesting thing about content-management systems and other stateful systems\\nis that the data they work with makes each running program specialized. Adam’s\\nWordPress blog is different from Betty’s WordPress blog, even if they’re running the\\nsame software. Only the content is different. Even if the content is the same, they’re\\ndifferent because they’re running on different sites.\\nIf you build systems or software that know too much about their environment—for\\nexample, addresses or fixed locations of dependency services—it’s difficult to change\\nthat environment or reuse the software. You need to deliver a system that minimizes\\nenvironment dependence before the contract is complete.\\nBuilding environment-agnostic systems\\nMuch of the work associated with installing software or maintaining a fleet of comput-\\ners lies in dealing with specializations of the computing environment. These special-\\nizations come as global-scoped dependencies (for example, known host filesystem\\nlocations), hardcoded deployment architectures (environment checks in code or con-\\nfiguration), or data locality (data stored on a particular computer outside the deploy-\\nment architecture). Knowing this, if your goal is to build low-maintenance systems,\\nyou should strive to minimize these things.\\nDocker has three specific features to help build environment-agnostic systems:\\n\\uf0a1Read-only filesystems\\n\\uf0a1Environment variable injection\\n\\uf0a1Volumes\\nWorking with volumes is a big subject and the topic of chapter 4. To learn the first two\\nfeatures, consider a requirement change for the example situation used in the rest of\\nthis chapter: WordPress uses a database program called MySQL to store most of its\\ndata, so it’s a good idea to provide the container running WordPress with a read-only\\nfilesystem to ensure data is written only to the database.\\nRead-only filesystems\\nUsing read-only filesystems accomplishes two positive things. First, you can have\\nconfidence that the container won’t be specialized from changes to the files it con-\\ntains. Second, you have increased confidence that an attacker can’t compromise\\nfiles in the container.\\nTo get started working on your client’s system, create and start a container from\\nthe WordPress image by using the --read-only flag:\\ndocker run -d --name wp --read-only \\\\\\nwordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache\\n35\\nBuilding environment-agnostic systems\\n \\nWhen this is finished, check that the container is running. You can do so using any of\\nthe methods introduced previously, or you can inspect the container metadata directly.\\nThe following command will print true if the container named wp is running, and\\nfalse otherwise:\\ndocker inspect --format \"{{.State.Running}}\" wp\\nThe docker inspect command will display all the metadata (a JSON document) that\\nDocker maintains for a container. The format option transforms that metadata, and in\\nthis case, it filters everything except for the field indicating the running state of the\\ncontainer. This command should simply output false.\\nIn this case, the container isn’t running. To determine why, examine the logs for\\nthe container:\\ndocker logs wp\\nThat command should output something like this:\\nWordPress not found in /var/www/html - copying now...\\nComplete! WordPress has been successfully copied to /var/www/html\\n... skip output ...\\nWed Dec 12 15:17:36 2018 (1): Fatal Error Unable to create lock file: ↵\\nBad file descriptor (9)\\nWhen running WordPress with a read-only filesystem, the Apache web server process\\nreports that it is unable to create a lock file. Unfortunately, it does not report the loca-\\ntion of the files it is trying to create. If we have the locations, we can create exceptions\\nfor them. Let’s run a WordPress container with a writable filesystem so that Apache is\\nfree to write where it wants:\\ndocker run -d --name wp_writable wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache\\nNow let’s check where Apache changed the container’s filesystem with the docker\\ndiff command:\\ndocker container diff wp_writable\\nC /run\\nC /run/apache2\\nA /run/apache2/apache2.pid\\nWe will explain the diff command and how Docker knows what changed on the\\nfilesystem in more detail in chapter 3. For now, it’s sufficient to know that the output\\nindicates that Apache created the /run/apache2 directory and added the apache2.pid\\nfile inside it.\\nSince this is an expected part of normal application operation, we will make an\\nexception to the read-only filesystem. We will allow the container to write to\\n36\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\n/run/apache2 by using a writable volume mounted from the host.

By\\nusing a read-only filesystem and linking WordPress to another container running a\\ndatabase, you can be sure that the container running the WordPress image will never\\nchange. This means that if there is ever something wrong with the computer running\\na client’s WordPress blog, you should be able to start up another copy of that con-\\ntainer elsewhere with no problems.\\nBut this design has two problems. First, the database is running in a container on\\nthe same computer as the WordPress container. Second, WordPress is using several\\ndefault values for important settings such as database name, administrative user,\\nadministrative password, database salt, and so on.\\nTo deal with this problem, you could create several versions of the WordPress soft-\\nware, each with a special configuration for the client. Doing so would turn your simple\\nprovisioning script into a monster that creates images and writes files. A better way to\\ninject that configuration would be through the use of environment variables.\\nEnvironment variable injection\\nEnvironment variables are key/value pairs that are made available to programs through\\ntheir execution context. They let you change a program’s configuration without mod-\\nifying any files or changing the command used to start the program.\\nDocker uses environment variables to communicate information about dependent\\ncontainers, the hostname of the container, and other convenient information for pro-\\ngrams running in containers. Docker also provides a mechanism for a user to inject\\nenvironment variables into a new container. Programs that know to expect important\\ninformation through environment variables can be configured at container-creation\\ntime. Luckily for you and your client, WordPress is one such program.\\n38\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\n Before diving into WordPress specifics, try injecting and viewing environment vari-\\nables on your own. The UNIX command env displays all the environment variables in\\nthe current execution context (your terminal). To see environment variable injection\\nin action, use the following command:\\ndocker run --env MY_ENVIRONMENT_VAR=\"this is a test\" \\\\      \\n    busybox:1.29 \\\\\\n    env           \\n \\n \\nInjects an environment \\nvariable\\nExecutes the env command \\ninside the container\\nThe --env flag, or -e for short, can be used to inject any environment variable. If the\\nvariable is already set by the image or Docker, the value will be overridden. This way,\\nprograms running inside containers can rely on the variables always being set. Word-\\nPress observes the following environment variables:\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_DB_HOST\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_DB_USER\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_DB_NAME\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT\\n\\uf0a1\\nWORDPRESS_NONCE_SALT\\nTIP\\nThis example neglects the KEY and SALT variables, but any real produc-\\ntion system should absolutely set these values.\\nTo get started, you should address the problem that the database is running in a con-\\ntainer on the same computer as the WordPress container. Rather than using linking to\\nsatisfy WordPress’s database dependency, inject a value for the WORDPRESS_DB_HOST\\nvariable:\\ndocker create --env WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=<my database hostname> \\\\\\nwordpress: 5.0.0-php7.2-apache\\nThis example would create (not start) a container for WordPress that will try to connect\\nto a MySQL database at whatever you specify at <my database hostname>. Because the\\nremote database isn’t likely using any default username or password, you’ll have to\\ninject values for those settings as well. Suppose the database administrator is a cat lover\\nand hates strong passwords:\\ndocker create \\\\\\n--env WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=<my database hostname> \\\\\\n--env WORDPRESS_DB_USER=site_admin \\\\\\n39\\nBuilding environment-agnostic systems\\n    --env WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=MeowMix42 \\\\\\n    wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache\\nUsing environment variable injection this way will help you separate the physical ties\\nbetween a WordPress container and a MySQL container. Even when you want to host\\nthe database and your customer WordPress sites all on the same machine, you’ll still\\nneed to fix the second problem mentioned earlier. All the sites are using the same\\ndefault database name, which means different clients will be sharing a single database.\\nYou’ll need to use environment variable injection to set the database name for each\\nindependent site by specifying the WORDPRESS_DB_NAME variable: \\ndocker create --link wpdb:mysql \\\\\\n    -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=client_a_wp \\\\  \\n    wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache\\ndocker create --link wpdb:mysql \\\\\\n    -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=client_b_wp \\\\  \\n    wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache\\nNow that you understand how to inject configuration into the WordPress application\\nand connect it to collaborating processes, let’s adapt the provisioning script. First, let’s\\nstart database and mailer containers that will be shared by our clients and store the\\ncontainer IDs in environment variables:\\nexport DB_CID=$(docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ch2demo mysql:5.7)\\nexport MAILER_CID=$(docker run -d dockerinaction/ch2_mailer) \\nNow update the client site provisioning script to read the database container ID,\\nmailer container ID, and a new CLIENT_ID from environment variables:\\n#!/bin/sh\\nif [ ! -n \"$CLIENT_ID\" ]; then   \\n    echo \"Client ID not set\"\\n    exit 1 \\nfi\\nWP_CID=$(docker create \\\\\\n    --link $DB_CID:mysql \\\\   \\n    --name wp_$CLIENT_ID \\\\\\n    -p 80 \\\\\\n    --read-only -v /run/apache2/ --tmpfs /tmp \\\\\\n    -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=$CLIENT_ID \\\\\\n    --read-only wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache)\\ndocker start $WP_CID\\nAGENT_CID=$(docker create \\\\\\n        --name agent_$CLIENT_ID \\\\\\n    --link $WP_CID:insideweb \\\\\\nFor client A\\nFor client B\\nAssumes $CLIENT_ID variable \\nis set as input to script\\nCreates link \\nusing DB_CID\\n40\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\n    --link $MAILER_CID:insidemailer \\\\\\n    dockerinaction/ch2_agent)\\ndocker start $AGENT_CID\\nIf you save this script to a file named start-wp-for-client.sh, you can provision Word-\\nPress for the dockerinaction client by using a command like this:\\nCLIENT_ID=dockerinaction ./start-wp-multiple-clients.sh\\nThis new script will start an instance of WordPress and the monitoring agent for each\\ncustomer and connect those containers to each other as well as a single mailer pro-\\ngram and MySQL database. The WordPress containers can be destroyed, restarted,\\nand upgraded without any worry about loss of data. Figure 2.4 shows this architecture.\\n2.5\\nwp_$CLIENT_ID\\nagent_$CLIENT_ID\\nDB_CID\\nMAILER_CID\\nFigure 2.4\\nEach WordPress and \\nagent container uses the same \\ndatabase and mailer.\\nThe client should be pleased with what is being delivered. But one thing might be\\nbothering you. In earlier testing, you found that the monitoring agent correctly noti-\\nfied the mailer when the site was unavailable, but restarting the site and agent\\nrequired manual work. It would be better if the system tried to automatically recover\\nwhen a failure was detected. Docker provides restart policies to help deal with that,\\nbut you might want something more robust.\\nBuilding durable containers\\nSoftware may fail in rare conditions that are temporary in nature. Although it’s\\nimportant to be made aware when these conditions arise, it’s usually at least as import-\\nant to restore the service as quickly as possible. The monitoring system that you built\\nin this chapter is a fine start for keeping system owners aware of problems with a sys-\\ntem, but it does nothing to help restore service.\\n41\\nBuilding durable containers\\n2.5.1\\nWhen all the processes in a container have exited, that container will enter the\\nexited state. Remember, a Docker container can be in one of six states:\\n\\uf0a1\\nCreated\\n\\uf0a1\\nRunning\\n\\uf0a1\\nRestarting\\n\\uf0a1\\nPaused\\n\\uf0a1\\nRemoving\\n\\uf0a1\\nExited (also used if the container has never been started)\\nA basic strategy for recovering from temporary failures is automatically restarting a\\nprocess when it exits or fails. Docker provides a few options for monitoring and\\nrestarting containers.\\nAutomatically restarting containers\\nDocker provides this functionality with a restart policy. Using the --restart flag at\\ncontainer-creation time, you can tell Docker to do any of the following:\\n\\uf0a1Never restart (default)\\n\\uf0a1Attempt to restart when a failure is detected\\n\\uf0a1Attempt for some predetermined time to restart when a failure is detected\\n\\uf0a1Always restart the container regardless of the condition\\nDocker doesn’t always attempt to immediately restart a container. If it did, that would\\ncause more problems than it solved. Imagine a container that does nothing but print\\nthe time and exit. If that container was configured to always restart, and Docker always\\nimmediately restarted it, the system would do nothing but restart that container.\\nInstead, Docker uses an exponential backoff strategy for timing restart attempts.\\nA backoff strategy determines the amount of time that should pass between succes-\\nsive restart attempts. An exponential back-off strategy will do something like double\\nthe previous time spent waiting on each successive attempt. For example, if the first\\ntime the container needs to be restarted Docker waits 1 second, then on the second\\nattempt it would wait 2 seconds, 4 seconds on the third attempt, 8 on the fourth, and\\nso on. Exponential backoff strategies with low initial wait times are a common service-\\nrestoration technique. You can see Docker employ this strategy yourself by building a\\ncontainer that always restarts and simply prints the time:\\ndocker run -d --name backoff-detector --restart always busybox:1.29 date\\nThen after a few seconds, use the trailing logs feature to watch it back off and restart:\\ndocker logs -f backoff-detector\\nThe logs will show all the times it has already been restarted and will wait until the\\nnext time it is restarted, print the current time, and then exit. Adding this single flag\\n42\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\nto the monitoring system and the WordPress containers you’ve been working on\\nwould solve the recovery issue.\\n The only reason you might not want to adopt this directly is that during backoff\\nperiods, the container isn’t running. Containers waiting to be restarted are in the\\nrestarting state. To demonstrate, try to run another process in the backoff-detector\\ncontainer:\\ndocker exec backoff-detector echo Just a Test\\nRunning that command should result in an error message:\\nContainer <ID> is restarting, wait until the container is running\\nThat means you can’t do anything that requires the container to be in a running state,\\nsuch as execute additional commands in the container. That could be a problem if\\nyou need to run diagnostic programs in a broken container. A more complete strategy\\nis to use containers that start lightweight init systems.\\nUsing PID 1 and init systems\\n2.5.2\\nAn init system is a program that’s used to launch and maintain the state of other pro-\\ngrams. Any process with PID 1 is treated like an init process by the Linux kernel (even\\nif it is not technically an init system). In addition to other critical functions, an init sys-\\ntem starts other processes, restarts them in the event that they fail, transforms and for-\\nwards signals sent by the operating system, and prevents resource leaks. It is common\\npractice to use real init systems inside containers when that container will run multi-\\nple processes or if the program being run uses child processes.\\n Several such init systems could be used inside a container. The most popular\\ninclude runit, Yelp/dumb-init, tini, supervisord, and tianon/gosu. Publishing\\nsoftware that uses these programs is covered in chapter 8. For now, take a look at a\\ncontainer that uses supervisord.\\n Docker provides an image that contains a full LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL\\nPHP) stack inside a single container. Containers created this way use supervisord to\\nmake sure that all the related processes are kept running. Start an example container:\\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 --name lamp-test tutum/lamp\\nYou can see which processes are running inside this container by using the docker top\\ncommand:\\ndocker top lamp-test\\nThe top subcommand will show the host PID for each of the processes in the con-\\ntainer. You’ll see supervisord, mysql, and apache included in the list of running pro-\\ngrams. Now that the container is running, you can test the supervisord restart\\nfunctionality by manually stopping one of the processes inside the container. \\n43\\nBuilding durable containers\\n The problem is that to kill a process inside a container from within that container,\\nyou need to know the PID in the container’s PID namespace. To get that list, run the\\nfollowing exec subcommand:\\ndocker exec lamp-test ps\\nThe process list generated will list apache2 in the CMD column:\\nPID TTY          TIME CMD\\n  1 ?        00:00:00 supervisord\\n433 ?        00:00:00 mysqld_safe\\n835 ?        00:00:00 apache2\\n842 ?        00:00:00 ps\\nThe values in the PID column will be different when you run the command. Find the\\nPID on the row for apache2 and then insert that for <PID> in the following command:\\ndocker exec lamp-test kill <PID>\\nRunning this command will run the Linux kill program inside the lamp-test con-\\ntainer and tell the apache2 process to shut down. When apache2 stops, the supervisord\\nprocess will log the event and restart the process. The container logs will clearly show\\nthese events:\\n...\\n... exited: apache2 (exit status 0; expected)\\n... spawned: \\'apache2\\' with pid 820\\n... success: apache2 entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for >\\nthan 1 seconds (startsecs)\\nA common alternative to the use of init systems is using a startup script that at least\\nchecks the preconditions for successfully starting the contained software. These are\\nsometimes used as the default command for the container. For example, the Word-\\nPress containers that you’ve created start by running a script to validate and set\\ndefault environment variables before starting the WordPress process. You can view\\nthis script by overriding the default command with one to view the contents of the\\nstartup script:\\ndocker run wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache \\\\\\ncat /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh\\nDocker containers run something called an entrypoint before executing the command.\\nEntrypoints are perfect places to put code that validates the preconditions of a con-\\ntainer. Although this is discussed in depth in part 2 of this book, you need to know\\nhow to override or specifically set the entrypoint of a container on the command line.\\nTry running the last command again, but this time using the --entrypoint flag to\\nspecify the program to run and using the command section to pass arguments:\\n44\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\ndocker run --entrypoint=\"cat\" \\\\         \\n    wordpress:5.0.0-php7.2-apache \\\\\\n    /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh    \\n2.6\\n \\n \\nUses “cat” as \\nthe entrypoint\\nPasses the full path of the default\\nentrypoint script as an argument to cat\\nIf you run through the displayed script, you’ll see how it validates the environment vari-\\nables against the dependencies of the software and sets default values. Once the script\\nhas validated that WordPress can execute, it will start the requested or default command.\\nStartup scripts are an important part of building durable containers and can always\\nbe combined with Docker restart policies to take advantage of the strengths of each.\\nBecause both the MySQL and WordPress containers already use startup scripts, it’s\\nappropriate to simply set the restart policy for each in an updated version of the exam-\\nple script.\\nRunning startup scripts as PID 1 is problematic when the script fails to meet the\\nexpectations that Linux has for init systems. Depending on your use case, you might\\nfind that one approach or a hybrid works best.\\nWith that final modification, you’ve built a complete WordPress site-provisioning\\nsystem and learned the basics of container management with Docker. It has taken con-\\nsiderable experimentation. Your computer is likely littered with several containers\\nthat you no longer need. To reclaim the resources that those containers are using, you\\nneed to stop them and remove them from your system.\\nCleaning up\\nEase of cleanup is one of the strongest reasons to use containers and Docker. The iso-\\nlation that containers provide simplifies any steps that you’d have to take to stop pro-\\ncesses and remove files. With Docker, the whole cleanup process is reduced to one of\\na few simple commands. In any cleanup task, you must first identify the container that\\nyou want to stop and/or remove. Remember, to list all the containers on your com-\\nputer, use the docker ps command:\\ndocker ps -a\\nBecause the containers you created for the examples in this chapter won’t be used\\nagain, you should be able to safely stop and remove all the listed containers. Make\\nsure you pay attention to the containers you’re cleaning up if there are any that you\\ncreated for your own activities.\\nAll containers use hard drive space to store logs, container metadata, and files that\\nhave been written to the container filesystem. All containers also consume resources\\nin the global namespace such as container names and host port mappings. In most\\ncases, containers that will no longer be used should be removed.\\nTo remove a container from your computer, use the docker rm command. For\\nexample, to delete the stopped container named wp, you’d run this:\\ndocker rm wp\\n45\\nSummary\\nYou should go through all the containers in the list you generated by running docker ps\\n-a and remove all containers that are in the exited state. If you try to remove a container\\nthat’s running, paused, or restarting, Docker will display a message like the following:\\nError response from daemon: Conflict, You cannot remove a running \\ncontainer. Stop the container before attempting removal or use -f\\nFATA[0000] Error: failed to remove one or more containers\\nThe processes running in a container should be stopped before the files in the con-\\ntainer are removed. You can do this with the docker stop command or by using the -f\\nflag on docker rm. The key difference is that when you stop a process by using the -f flag,\\nDocker sends a SIG_KILL signal, which immediately terminates the receiving process.\\nIn contrast, using docker stop will send a SIG_HUP signal. Recipients of SIG_HUP have\\ntime to perform finalization and cleanup tasks. The SIG_KILL signal makes for no\\nsuch allowances and can result in file corruption or poor network experiences. You\\ncan issue a SIG_KILL directly to a container by using the docker kill command. But\\nyou should use docker kill or docker rm -f only if you must stop the container in less\\nthan the standard 30-second maximum stop time.\\n In the future, if you’re experimenting with short-lived containers, you can avoid\\nthe cleanup burden by specifying --rm on the command. Doing so will automatically\\nremove the container as soon as it enters the exited state. For example, the following\\ncommand will write a message to the screen in a new BusyBox container, and the con-\\ntainer will be removed as soon as it exits:\\ndocker run --rm --name auto-exit-test busybox:1.29 echo Hello World\\ndocker ps -a\\nIn this case, you could use either docker stop or docker rm to properly clean up, or it\\nwould be appropriate to use the single-step docker rm -f command. You should also\\nuse the -v flag for reasons that will be covered in chapter 4. The docker CLI makes it\\nis easy to compose a quick cleanup command:\\ndocker rm -vf $(docker ps -a -q)\\nThis concludes the basics of running software in containers. Each chapter in the\\nremainder of part 1 will focus on a specific aspect of working with containers. The\\nnext chapter focuses on installing and uninstalling images, understanding how images\\nrelate to containers, and working with container filesystems. \\nSummary\\nThe primary focus of the Docker project is to enable users to run software in contain-\\ners. This chapter shows how you can use Docker for that purpose. The ideas and fea-\\ntures covered include the following:\\n\\uf0a1Containers can be run with virtual terminals attached to the user’s shell or in\\ndetached mode.\\n46\\nCHAPTER 2\\nRunning software in containers\\n\\uf0a1By default, every Docker container has its own PID namespace, isolating process\\ninformation for each container.\\n\\uf0a1Docker identifies every container by its generated container ID, abbreviated\\ncontainer ID, or its human-friendly name.\\n\\uf0a1All containers are in any one of six distinct states: created, running, restarting,\\npaused, removing, or exited.\\n\\uf0a1The docker exec command can be used to run additional processes inside a\\nrunning container. \\n\\uf0a1A user can pass input or provide additional configuration to a process in a con-\\ntainer by specifying environment variables at container-creation time.\\n\\uf0a1Using the --read-only flag at container-creation time will mount the container\\nfilesystem as read-only and prevent specialization of the container.\\n\\uf0a1A container restart policy, set with the --restart flag at container-creation\\ntime, will help your systems automatically recover in the event of a failure.\\n\\uf0a1Docker makes cleaning up containers with the docker rm command as simple as\\ncreating them.\\nSoftware installation\\nsimplified\\nChapters 1 and 2 introduced new concepts and abstractions provided by Docker.\\nThis chapter dives deeper into container filesystems and software installation. It\\nbreaks software installation into three steps, as illustrated in figure 3.1.\\nThis chapter covers\\n\\uf0a1Identifying software\\n\\uf0a1Finding and installing software with Docker Hub\\n\\uf0a1Installing software from alternative sources\\n\\uf0a1Understanding filesystem isolation\\n\\uf0a1Working with images and layers\\nHow do I\\nidentify\\nsoftware?\\nWhere do I\\nﬁnd software\\nto install?\\nWhat ﬁles are\\ninstalled and\\nhow are they\\nisolated?\\nFlow of topics covered in this chapter\\nFigure 3.1\\nThe first step in installing any software is identifying the software you want to\\ninstall. You know that software is distributed using images, but you need to know\\n47\\n48\\nCHAPTER 3\\nSoftware installation simplified\\nhow to tell Docker exactly which image you want to install. We’ve already mentioned\\nthat repositories hold images, but this chapter shows how repositories and tags are\\nused to identify images in order to install the software you want.\\n This chapter details the three main ways to install Docker images: \\n\\uf0a1Using Docker registries\\n\\uf0a1Using image files with docker save and docker load\\n\\uf0a1Building images with Dockerfiles\\nIn the course of reading this material, you’ll learn how Docker isolates installed soft-\\nware and you’ll be exposed to a new term, layer. Layers, an important concept when\\ndealing with images, provide multiple important features. This chapter closes with a\\nsection about how images work. That knowledge will help you evaluate image quality\\nand establish a baseline skillset for part 2 of this book.\\nIdentifying software\\n3.1\\nSuppose you want to install a program called TotallyAwesomeBlog 2.0. How would you\\ntell Docker what you want to install? You would need a way to name the program, spec-\\nify the version that you want to use, and specify the source that you want to install it\\nfrom. Learning how to identify specific software is the first step in software installa-\\ntion, as illustrated in figure 3.2.\\n3.1.1\\nHow do I\\nidentify\\nsoftware?\\nWhere do I\\nﬁnd software\\nto install?\\nWhat ﬁles are\\ninstalled and\\nhow are they\\nisolated?\\nFigure 3.2\\nStep 1—software \\nidentification\\nYou’ve learned that Docker creates containers from images. An image is a file. It holds\\nfiles that will be available to containers created from it and metadata about the image.\\nThis metadata contains labels, environment variables, default execution context, the\\ncommand history for an image, and more.\\nEvery image has a globally unique identifier. You can use that identifier with image\\nand container commands, but in practice it’s rare to actually work with raw image\\nidentifiers. They are long, unique sequences of letters and numbers. Each time a\\nchange is made to an image, the image identifier changes. Image identifiers are diffi-\\ncult to work with because they’re unpredictable. Instead, users work with named\\nrepositories.\\nWhat is a named repository?\\nA named repository is a named bucket of images. The name is similar to a URL. A\\nrepository’s name is made up of the name of the host where the image is located,\\nthe user account that owns the image, and a short name, as shown in figure 3.3. For\\nexample, later in this chapter you will install an image from the repository named\\ndocker.io/dockerinaction/ch3_hello_registry.\\n49\\nIdentifying software\\n3.1.2\\ndocker.io/dockerinaction/ch3_hello_registry\\nUser or organization name\\nRegistry host\\nRepository name\\nShort name\\nFigure 3.3\\nThe Docker image \\nrepository name\\nJust as there can be several versions of software, a repository can hold several images.\\nEach image in a repository is identified uniquely with tags. If you were to release a new\\nversion of docker.io/dockerinaction/ch3_hello_registry, you might tag it v2\\nwhile tagging the old version with v1. If you wanted to download the old version, you\\ncould specifically identify that image by its v1 tag.\\nIn chapter 2, you installed an image from the NGINX repository on Docker Hub\\nthat was identified with the latest tag. A repository name and tag form a composite key,\\nor a unique reference made up of a combination of nonunique components. In that\\nexample, the image was identified by nginx:latest. Although identifiers built in this\\nfashion may occasionally be longer than raw image identifiers, they’re predictable and\\ncommunicate the intention of the image.\\nUsing tags\\nTags are both an important way to uniquely identify an image and a convenient way to\\ncreate useful aliases. Whereas a tag can be applied to only a single image in a reposi-\\ntory, a single image can have several tags. This allows repository owners to create use-\\nful versioning or feature tags.\\nFor example, the Java repository on Docker Hub maintains the following tags:\\n11-stretch, 11-jdk-stretch, 11.0-stretch, 11.0-jdk-stretch, 11.0.4-stretch,\\nand 11.0.4-jdk-stretch. All these tags are applied to the same image. This image is\\nbuilt by installing the current Java 11 Development Kit (JDK) into a Debian Stretch\\nbase image. As the current patch version of Java 11 increases, and the maintainers\\nrelease Java 11.0.5, the 11.0.4 tag will be replaced in this set with 11.0.5. If you care\\nabout which minor or patch version of Java 11 you’re running, you have to keep up\\nwith those tag changes. If you just want to make sure you’re always running the most\\nrecent version of Java 11, use the image tagged with 11-stretch. It should always be\\nassigned to the newest release of Java 11. These tags give users great flexibility.\\nIt’s also common to see different tags for images with different software configu-\\nrations. For example, we’ve released two images for an open source program called\\nfreegeoip. It’s a web application that can be used to get the rough geographical\\nlocation associated with a network address. One image is configured to use the\\ndefault configuration for the software. It’s meant to run by itself with a direct link to\\nthe world. The second is configured to run behind a web load balancer. Each image\\n50\\nCHAPTER 3\\nSoftware installation simplified\\nhas a distinct tag that allows the user to easily identify the image with the features\\nrequired.\\nTIP\\nWhen you’re looking for software to install, always pay careful atten-\\ntion to the tags offered in a repository. Many repositories publish multiple\\nreleases of their software, sometimes on multiple operating systems or in full\\nor slim versions to support different use cases. Consult the repository\\'s docu-\\nmentation for specifics of what the repository\\'s tags mean and the image\\nrelease practices.\\nThat is all there is to identifying software for use with Docker. With this knowledge,\\nyou’re ready to start looking for and installing software with Docker.\\nFinding and installing software\\n3.2\\nYou can identify software by a repository name, but how do you find the repositories\\nthat you want to install? Discovering trustworthy software is complex, and it is the sec-\\nond step in learning how to install software with Docker, as shown in figure 3.4.\\n \\n \\n \\n3.2.1\\nHow do I\\nidentify\\nsoftware?\\nWhere do I\\nﬁnd software\\nto install?\\nWhat ﬁles are\\ninstalled and\\nhow are they\\nisolated?\\nFigure 3.4\\nStep 2—locating \\nrepositories\\nThe easiest way to find images is to use an index. Indexes are search engines that cata-\\nlog repositories. There are several public Docker indexes, but by default docker is\\nintegrated with an index named Docker Hub.\\nDocker Hub is a registry and index with a web user interface run by Docker Inc. It’s\\nthe default registry and index used by docker and is located at the host docker.io.\\nWhen you issue a docker pull or docker run command without specifying an alterna-\\ntive registry, Docker will default to looking for the repository on Docker Hub. Docker\\nHub makes Docker more useful out of the box.\\nDocker Inc. has made efforts to ensure that Docker is an open ecosystem. It pub-\\nlishes a public image to run your own registry, and the docker command-line tool\\ncan be easily configured to use alternative registries. Later in this chapter, we cover\\nalternative image installation and distribution tools included with Docker. But first,\\nthe next section covers how to use Docker Hub so you can get the most from the\\ndefault toolset.\\nWorking with Docker registries from the command line\\nAn image author can publish images to a registry such as Docker Hub in two ways:\\n\\uf0a1Use the command line to push images that they built independently and on their own systems.\\n\\uf0a1Make a Dockerfile publicly available and use a continuous build system to publish images.\\nDockerfiles are scripts for building images. Images created from these automated\\n51\\nFinding and installing software\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3.2.2\\nbuilds are preferred because the Dockerfile is available for examination prior\\nto installing the image.\\nMost registries will require image authors to authenticate before publishing and\\nenforce authorization checks on the repository they are updating. In these cases, you\\ncan use the docker login command to log in to specific registry servers such as\\nDocker Hub. Once you’ve logged in, you’ll be able to pull from private repositories,\\ntag images in your repositories, and push to any repository that you control. Chapter 7\\ncovers tagging and pushing images.\\nRunning docker login will prompt you for your Docker.com credentials. Once\\nyou’ve provided them, your command-line client will be authenticated, and you’ll be\\nable to access your private repositories. When you’ve finished working with your\\naccount, you can log out with the docker logout command. If you’re using a different\\nregistry, you can specify the server name as an argument to the docker login and\\ndocker logout subcommands.\\nUsing alternative registries\\nDocker makes the registry software available for anyone to run. Cloud companies\\nincluding AWS and Google offer private registries, and companies that use Docker EE\\nor that use the popular Artifactory project already have private registries. Running a\\nregistry from open source components is covered in chapter 8, but it’s important that\\nyou learn how to use them early.\\nUsing an alternative registry is simple. It requires no additional configuration. All\\nyou need is the address of the registry. The following command will download\\nanother “Hello, World” type of example from an alternative registry:\\ndocker pull quay.io/dockerinaction/ch3_hello_registry:latest\\nThe registry address is part of the full repository specification covered in section 3.1.\\nThe full pattern is as follows:\\n[REGISTRYHOST:PORT/][USERNAME/]NAME[:TAG]\\nDocker knows how to talk to Docker registries, so the only difference is that you\\nspecify the registry host. In some cases, working with registries will require an authen-\\ntication step. If you encounter a situation where this is the case, consult the docu-\\nmentation or the group that configured the registry to find out more. When you’re\\nfinished with the hello-registry image you installed, remove it with the following\\ncommand:\\ndocker rmi quay.io/dockerinaction/ch3_hello_registry\\nRegistries are powerful. They enable a user to relinquish control of image storage and\\ntransportation. But running your own registry can be complicated and may create a\\n52\\nCHAPTER 3\\nSoftware installation simplified\\npotential single point of failure for your deployment infrastructure. If running a custom\\nregistry sounds a bit complicated for your use case, and third-party distribution tools\\nare out of the question, you might consider loading images directly from a file.\\nWorking with images as files\\n3.2.3\\nDocker provides a command to load images into Docker from a file. With this tool,\\nyou can load images that you acquired through other channels. Maybe your company\\nhas chosen to distribute images through a central file server or some type of version-\\ncontrol system. Maybe the image is small enough that your friend just sent it to you\\nover email or shared it via flash drive. However you came upon the file, you can load it\\ninto Docker with the docker load command.\\n You’ll need an image file to load before we can show you the docker load com-\\nmand. Because it’s unlikely that you have an image file lying around, we’ll show you\\nhow to save one from a loaded image. For the purposes of this example, you’ll pull\\nbusybox:latest. That image is small and easy to work with. To save that image to a\\nfile, use the docker save command. Figure 3.5 demonstrates docker save by creating\\na file from BusyBox.\\n \\nInstall an image\\nto export.\\ndocker pull busybox:latest\\ndocker save -o myﬁle.tar busybox:latest\\nThe\\ncommand\\nsave\\nexports an image.\\nThe\\nimage is\\nbusybox:latest\\nsmall and a good example.\\nUsing\\n, you can\\n-o\\nspecify the name of\\nthe output ﬁle.\\nName of the image\\nyou want to export\\nFigure 3.5\\nParts of the pull \\nand save subcommands\\nWe used the .tar filename suffix in this example because the docker save command\\ncreates TAR archive files. You can use any filename you want. If you omit the –o flag,\\nthe resulting file will be streamed to the terminal.\\nTIP\\nOther ecosystems that use TAR archives for packing define custom file\\nextensions. For example, Java uses .jar, .war, and .ear. In cases like these,\\nusing custom file extensions can help hint at the purpose and content of the\\narchive. Although there are no defaults set by Docker and no official guid-\\nance on the matter, you may find using a custom extension useful if you work\\nwith these files often.\\n53\\nFinding and installing software\\nAfter running the save command, the docker program will terminate unceremoni-\\nously. Check that it worked by listing the contents of your current working directory. If\\nthe specified file is there, use this command to remove the image from Docker: \\ndocker rmi busybox\\nAfter removing the image, load it again from the file you created by using the\\ndocker load command. As with docker save, if you run docker load without the –i\\ncommand, Docker will use the standard input stream instead of reading the archive\\nfrom a file:\\ndocker load –i myfile.tar\\nOnce you’ve run the docker load command, the image should be loaded. You can\\nverify this by running the docker images command again. If everything worked cor-\\nrectly, BusyBox should be included in the list. \\n Working with images as files is as easy as working with registries, but you miss out\\non all the nice distribution facilities that registries provide. If you want to build your\\nown distribution tools, or you already have something else in place, it should be trivial\\nto integrate with Docker by using these commands. \\n Another popular project distribution pattern uses bundles of files with installation\\nscripts. This approach is popular with open source projects that use public version-\\ncontrol repositories for distribution. In these cases, you work with a file, but the file is\\nnot an image; it is a Dockerfile.\\n3.2.4\\nInstalling from a Dockerfile\\nA Dockerfile is a script that describes steps for Docker to take to build a new image.\\nThese files are distributed along with software that the author wants to be put into an\\nimage. In this case, you’re not technically installing an image. Instead, you’re follow-\\ning instructions to build an image. Working with Dockerfiles is covered in depth in\\nchapter 7.\\n Distributing a Dockerfile is similar to distributing image files. You’re left to your\\nown distribution mechanisms. A common pattern is to distribute a Dockerfile with\\nsoftware from common version-control systems like Git or Mercurial. If you have Git\\ninstalled, you can try this by running an example from a public repository:\\ngit clone https://github.com/dockerinaction/ch3_dockerfile.git\\ndocker build -t dia_ch3/dockerfile:latest ch3_dockerfile\\nIn this example, you copy the project from a public source repository onto your com-\\nputer and then build and install a Docker image by using the Dockerfile included with\\nthat project. The value provided to the -t option of docker build is the repository\\nwhere you want to install the image. Building images from Dockerfiles is a light way to\\nmove projects around that fits into existing workflows. \\n54\\nCHAPTER 3\\nSoftware installation simplified\\n This approach has two disadvantages. First, depending on the specifics of the proj-\\nect, the build process might take some time. Second, dependencies may drift between\\nthe time when the Dockerfile was authored and when an image is built on a user’s\\ncomputer. These issues make distributing build files less than an ideal experience for\\na user. But it remains popular in spite of these drawbacks.\\n When you’re finished with this example, make sure to clean up your workspace:\\ndocker rmi dia_ch3/dockerfile\\nrm -rf ch3_dockerfile\\nUsing Docker Hub from the website\\n3.2.5\\nIf you have yet to stumble upon it while browsing the Docker website, you should\\ntake a moment to check out https://hub.docker.com. Docker Hub lets you search\\nfor repositories, organizations, or specific users. User and organization profile pages list\\nthe repositories that the account maintains, recent activity on the account, and the\\nrepositories that the account has starred. On repository pages you can see the following:\\n\\uf0a1General information about the image provided by the image publisher\\n\\uf0a1A list of the tags available in the repository\\n\\uf0a1The date the repository was created\\n\\uf0a1The number of times it has been downloaded\\n\\uf0a1Comments from registered users\\nDocker Hub is free to join, and you’ll need an account later in this book. When you’re\\nsigned in, you can star and comment on repositories. You can create and manage your\\nown repositories. We will do that in part 2. For now, just get a feel for the site and what\\nit has to offer.\\nActivity: A Docker Hub scavenger hunt\\nIt’s good to practice finding software on Docker Hub by using the skills you learned\\nin chapter 2. This activity is designed to encourage you to use Docker Hub and prac-\\ntice creating containers. You will also be introduced to three new options on the\\ndocker run command. \\nIn this activity, you’ll create containers from two images that are available through\\nDocker Hub. The first is available from the dockerinaction/ch3_ex2_hunt reposi-\\ntory. In that image, you’ll find a small program that prompts you for a password. You\\ncan find the password only by finding and running a container from the second mys-\\ntery repository on Docker Hub. To use the programs in these images, you need to\\nattach your terminal to the containers so that the input and output of your terminal\\nare connected directly to the running container. The following command demon-\\nstrates how to do that and run a container that will be removed automatically when\\nstopped:\\ndocker run -it --rm dockerinaction/ch3_ex2_hunt\\n55\\nFinding and installing software\\nDocker Hub is by no means the only source for software. Depending on the goals and\\nperspective of software publishers, Docker Hub may not be an appropriate distribu-\\ntion point. Closed source or proprietary projects may not want to risk publishing their\\nsoftware through a third party. You can install software in three other ways: \\n\\uf0a1You can use alternative repository registries or run your own registry. \\n\\uf0a1You can manually load images from a file.\\n\\uf0a1You can download a project from some other source and build an image by\\nusing a provided Dockerfile. \\nWhen you run this command, the scavenger hunt program will prompt you for the\\npassword. If you know the answer already, go ahead and enter it now. If not, just\\nenter anything, and it will give you a hint. At this point, you should have all the tools\\nyou need to complete the activity. The following diagram illustrates what you need to\\ndo from this point.\\nStill stuck? We can give you one more hint. The mystery repository is one that was\\ncreated for this book. Maybe you should try searching for this book’s Docker Hub\\nrepositories. Remember, repositories are named with a username/repository pattern. \\nWhen you get the answer, pat yourself on the back and remove the images by using\\nthe docker rmi command. The commands you run should look something like these:\\ndocker rmi dockerinaction/ch3_ex2_hunt \\ndocker rmi <mystery repository>\\nIf you were following the examples and using the --rm option on your docker run\\ncommands, you should have no containers to clean up. You learned a lot in this\\nexample. You found a new image on Docker Hub and used the docker run command\\nin a new way. There’s a lot to know about running interactive containers. The next\\nsection covers that in greater detail.\\nDocker Hub\\ndocker run -it --rm ????\\ndocker run -it --rm dockerinaction/ch3_hunt\\nFind the mystery repository on Docker Hub.\\nPull and create a container from the\\nlatest image in the mystery repository\\nto reveal the password.\\nThe password should be\\nprovided to the scavenger\\nhunt program.\\n56\\nCHAPTER 3\\nSoftware installation simplified\\nAll three options are viable for private projects or corporate infrastructure. The next\\nfew subsections cover how to install software from each alternative source. Chapter 9\\ncovers Docker image distribution in detail. After reading this section, you should have\\na complete picture of your options to install software with Docker. When you install\\nsoftware, you should have an idea about what is in the software package and the\\nchanges being made to your computer.\\nInstallation files and isolation\\n3.3\\nUnderstanding how images are identified, discovered, and installed is a minimum\\nproficiency for a Docker user. If you understand what files are actually installed and\\nhow those files are built and isolated at runtime, you’ll be able to answer more diffi-\\ncult questions that come up with experience, such as these:\\n\\uf0a1What image properties factor into download and installation speeds?\\n\\uf0a1What are all these unnamed images that are listed when I use the docker\\nimages command?\\n\\uf0a1Why does output from the docker pull command include messages about pull-\\ning dependent layers?\\n\\uf0a1Where are the files that I wrote to my container’s filesystem?\\nLearning this material is the third and final step to understanding software installa-\\ntion with Docker, as illustrated in figure 3.6.\\nSo far, when we’ve written about installing software, we’ve used the term image. This was\\nto infer that the software you were going to use was in a single image and that an image\\nwas contained within a single file. Although this may occasionally be accurate, most of\\nthe time what we’ve been calling an image is actually a collection of image layers. \\n A layer is set of files and file metadata that is packaged and distributed as an atomic\\nunit. Internally, Docker treats each layer like an image, and layers are often called\\nintermediate images. You can even promote a layer to an image by tagging it. Most layers\\nbuild upon a parent layer by applying filesystem changes to the parent. For example, a\\nlayer might update the software in an image with a package manager by using, for\\nexample, Debian’s apt-get update. The resulting image contains the combined set of\\nfiles from the parent and the layer that was added. It is easier to understand layers\\nwhen you see them in action.\\nHow do I\\nidentify\\nsoftware?\\nWhere do I\\nﬁnd software\\nto install?\\nWhat ﬁles are\\ninstalled and\\nhow are they\\nisolated?\\nStep 3—understanding how software is installed\\nFigure 3.6\\n57\\nInstallation files and isolation\\nImage layers in action\\n3.3.1\\nIn this example, you’ll install the two images. Both depend on Java 11. The applica-\\ntions themselves are simple “Hello, World”–style programs. We want you to keep an\\neye on what Docker does when you install each. You should notice how long it takes to\\ninstall the first compared to the second and read what the docker pull command\\nprints to the terminal. When an image is being installed, you can watch Docker deter-\\nmine which dependencies it needs to download and then see the progress of the indi-\\nvidual image layer downloads. Java is great for this example because the layers are\\nquite large, and that will give you a moment to really see Docker in action.\\n The two images you’re going to install are dockerinaction/ch3_myapp and\\ndockerinaction/ch3_myotherapp. You should just use the docker pull command\\nbecause you need to only see the images install, not start a container from them. Here\\nare the commands you should run:\\ndocker pull dockerinaction/ch3_myapp\\ndocker pull dockerinaction/ch3_myotherapp\\nDid you see it? Unless your network connection is far better than mine, or you had\\nalready installed OpenJDK 11.0.4 (slim) as a dependency of some other image,\\nthe download of dockerinaction/ch3_myapp should have been much slower than\\ndockerinaction/ch3_myotherapp.\\n When you installed ch3_myapp, Docker determined that it needed to install the\\nopenjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim image because it’s the direct dependency (parent layer) of\\nthe requested image. When Docker went to install that dependency, it discovered the\\ndependencies of that layer and downloaded those first. Once all the dependencies of\\na layer are installed, that layer is installed. Finally, openjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim was\\ninstalled, and then the tiny ch3_myapp layer was installed.\\n When you issued the command to install ch3_myotherapp, Docker identified that\\nopenjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim was already installed and immediately installed the image\\nfor ch3_myotherapp. Since the second application shared almost all of its image layers\\nwith the first application, Docker had much less to do. Installing the unique layer of\\nch3_myotherapp was very fast because less than one megabyte of data was transferred.\\nBut again, to the user it was an identical process. \\n From the user perspective, this ability is nice to have, but you wouldn’t want to\\nhave to try to optimize for it. Just take the benefits where they happen to work out.\\nFrom the perspective of a software or image author, this ability should play a major\\nfactor in your image design. Chapter 7 covers this in more detail.\\n If you run docker images now, you’ll see the following repositories listed:\\n\\uf0a1\\ndockerinaction/ch3_myapp\\n\\uf0a1\\ndockerinaction/ch3_myotherapp\\nBy default, the docker images command will show only repositories. As with other\\ncommands, if you specify the -a flag, the list will include every installed intermediate\\n58\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3.3.2\\n \\nCHAPTER 3\\nSoftware installation simplified\\nimage or layer. Running docker images -a will show a list that includes several reposi-\\ntories and may also include some listed as <none>. Unnamed images can exist for sev-\\neral reasons, such as building an image without tagging it. The only way to refer to\\nthese is to use the value in the IMAGE ID column.\\nIn this example, you installed two images. Let’s clean them up now. You can do so\\nmore easily if you use the condensed docker rmi syntax:\\ndocker rmi \\\\\\ndockerinaction/ch3_myapp \\\\\\ndockerinaction/ch3_myotherapp\\nThe docker rmi command allows you to specify a space-separated list of images to be\\nremoved. This comes in handy when you need to remove a small set of images after an\\nexample. We’ll be using this when appropriate throughout the rest of the examples in\\nthis book.\\nLayer relationships\\nImages maintain parent/child relationships. In these relationships, they build from\\ntheir parents and form layers. The files available to a container are the union of all lay-\\ners in the lineage of the image that the container was created from. Images can have\\nrelationships with any other image, including images in different repositories with dif-\\nferent owners. The two application images in section 3.3.1 use an OpenJDK 11.0.4\\nimage as their parent. The OpenJDK image’s parent is a minimal version of the\\nDebian Linux Buster operating system release. Figure 3.7 illustrates the full image\\nancestry of both images and the layers contained in each image.\\nThe images and layers in figure 3.7 show that the application images will inherit\\nthree layers from openjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim and one more layer from debian:buster-\\nslim. The three layers from OpenJDK contain common libraries and dependencies of\\nthe Java 11 software, and the Debian image contributes a minimal operating system\\ntoolchain.\\nAn image is named when its author tags and publishes it. A user can create aliases,\\nas you did in chapter 2 by using the docker tag command. Until an image is tagged,\\nthe only way to refer to it is to use its unique identifier (ID) that was generated when\\nthe image was built. In figure 3.7, the parent image of the OpenJDK 11.0.4 image is\\nthe Debian Buster OS whose ID is 83ed3c583403. The Debian image authors tagged\\nand published this image as debian:buster-slim. The figure labels these images with\\nthe first 12 digits of their image ID, a common convention. Docker truncates the ID\\nfrom 65 (base 16) digits to 12 in output of common commands for the benefit of its\\nhuman users. Internally and through API access, Docker uses the full 65.\\nEven these “slim” Java images are sizable and were chosen to illustrate a point. At\\nthe time of this writing, the openjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim image is 401 MB. You get some\\nspace savings when you use the runtime-only images, but even openjdk:11.0.4-jre-\\nslim-buster is 204 MB. Because Docker uniquely identifies images and layers, it is\\nable to recognize shared image dependencies between applications and avoid\\n59\\nInstallation files and isolation\\n3.3.3\\nLayers\\n43ec0532103a\\n...\\n0e7e4bd9d852\\nID: 0858f7736a46\\nLayers\\n608ce8f816b1\\n...\\ncaabcca9b2bf\\nID: c0a16f5f469c\\ndockerinaction/ch3_myotherapp\\nLayers\\n8d768709f9c6\\nd69b64e3e531\\nc6201b885bae\\nID: 4820fdebc4fb\\nopenjdk:11.0.4-jdk-slim\\nLayers\\nd8a33133e477\\nID: 83ed3c583403\\ndebian:buster-slim\\nscratch\\ndockerinaction/ch3_myapp\\nThe full lineage of the two Docker images used in section 3.3.1\\nFigure 3.7\\ndownloading those dependencies again. This is done without requiring any coordina-\\ntion between applications at runtime, only build time. Chapter 10 discusses image\\nbuild pipelines in depth. Let’s continue by examining container filesystems.\\nContainer filesystem abstraction and isolation\\nPrograms running inside containers know nothing about image layers. From inside a\\ncontainer, the filesystem operates as though it’s not running in a container or operat-\\ning on an image. From the perspective of the container, it has exclusive copies of the\\nfiles provided by the image. This is made possible with something called a union file-\\nsystem (UFS).\\nDocker uses a variety of union filesystems and will select the best fit for your sys-\\ntem. The details of how the union filesystem works are beyond what you need to know\\nto use Docker effectively. A union filesystem is part of a critical set of tools that com-\\nbine to create effective filesystem isolation. The other tools are MNT namespaces and\\nthe chroot system call.\\n60\\nCHAPTER 3\\nSoftware installation simplified\\n The filesystem is used to create mount points on your host’s filesystem that abstract\\nthe use of layers. The layers created are bundled into Docker image layers. Likewise,\\nwhen a Docker image is installed, its layers are unpacked and appropriately config-\\nured for use by the specific filesystem provider chosen for your system. \\n The Linux kernel provides a namespace for the MNT system. When Docker cre-\\nates a container, that new container will have its own MNT namespace, and a new\\nmount point will be created for the container to the image.\\n Lastly, chroot is used to make the root of the image filesystem the root in the con-\\ntainer’s context. This prevents anything running inside the container from referenc-\\ning any other part of the host filesystem.\\n Using chroot and MNT namespaces is common for container technologies. By\\nadding a union filesystem to the recipe, Docker containers have several benefits.\\nBenefits of this toolset and filesystem structure\\n3.3.4\\nThe first and perhaps most important benefit of this approach is that common lay-\\ners need to be installed only once. If you install any number of images and they all\\ndepend on a common layer, that common layer and all of its parent layers will need\\nto be downloaded or installed only once. This means you might be able to install\\nseveral specializations of a program without storing redundant files on your com-\\nputer or downloading redundant layers. By contrast, most virtual machine technolo-\\ngies will store the same files as many times as you have redundant virtual machines\\non a computer.\\n Second, layers provide a coarse tool for managing dependencies and separating\\nconcerns. This is especially handy for software authors, and chapter 7 talks more\\nabout this. From a user perspective, this benefit will help you quickly identify what\\nsoftware you’re running by examining which images and layers you’re using.\\n Lastly, it’s easy to create software specializations when you can layer minor changes\\non top of a basic image. That’s another subject covered in detail in chapter 7. Provid-\\ning specialized images helps users get exactly what they need from software with mini-\\nmal customization. This is one of the best reasons to use Docker.\\nWeaknesses of union filesystems\\n3.3.5\\nDocker selects sensible defaults when it is started, but no implementation is perfect\\nfor every workload. In fact, in some specific use cases, you should pause and consider\\nusing another Docker feature.\\n Different filesystems have different rules about file attributes, sizes, names, and char-\\nacters. Union filesystems are in a position where they often need to translate between\\nthe rules of different filesystems. In the best cases, they’re able to provide acceptable\\ntranslations. In the worst cases, features are omitted. For example, neither Btrfs nor\\nOverlayFS provides support for the extended attributes that make SELinux work.\\n Union filesystems use a pattern called copy-on-write, and that makes implementing\\nmemory-mapped files (the mmap system call) difficult. Some union filesystems provide\\n61\\nSummary\\nimplementations that work under the right conditions, but it may be a better idea to\\navoid memory-mapping files from an image.\\n The backing filesystem is another pluggable feature of Docker. You can determine\\nwhich filesystem your installation is using with the info subcommand. If you want to\\nspecifically tell Docker which filesystem to use, do so with the --storage-driver or -s\\noption when you start the Docker daemon. Most issues that arise with writing to the\\nunion filesystem can be addressed without changing the storage provider. These can\\nbe solved with volumes, the subject of chapter 4.\\nSummary\\nThe task of installing and managing software on a computer presents a unique set of\\nchallenges. This chapter explains how you can use Docker to address them. The core\\nideas and features covered by this chapter are as follows:\\n\\uf0a1Human users of Docker use repository names to communicate which software\\nthey would like Docker to install.\\n\\uf0a1Docker Hub is the default Docker registry. You can find software on Docker\\nHub through either the website or the docker command-line program. \\n\\uf0a1The docker command-line program makes it simple to install software that’s\\ndistributed through alternative registries or in other forms. \\n\\uf0a1The image repository specification includes a registry host field. \\n\\uf0a1The docker load and docker save commands can be used to load and save\\nimages from TAR archives.\\n\\uf0a1Distributing a Dockerfile with a project simplifies image builds on user machines.\\n\\uf0a1Images are usually related to other images in parent/child relationships. These\\nrelationships form layers. When we say that we have installed an image, we are\\nsaying that we have installed a target image and each image layer in its lineage. \\n\\uf0a1Structuring images with layers enables layer reuse and saves bandwidth during\\ndistribution and storage space on your computer and image distribution servers.\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":80}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["    # def __init__(self, titles,
